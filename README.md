Predicting Student Performance: A Simple Linear Regression Model

Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict the percentage of a student's performance based on the number of hours they study per day. To achieve this, we utilize a simple linear regression model implemented in Python, specifically using Google Colab as our development environment. 

Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates a student's percentage score based on their daily study hours. The project demonstrates a fundamental use case of data science and business analytics by leveraging a simple linear regression model.

Tools Used

Python: Programming language used for data analysis, model building, and data visualization.
Google Colab: Cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows collaborative work on Python projects.
Libraries: We'll be using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
