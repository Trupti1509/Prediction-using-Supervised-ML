Predicting Student Performance: A Simple Linear Regression Model
Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict the percentage of a student's performance based on the number of hours they study per day. To achieve this, we utilize a simple linear regression model implemented in Python, specifically using Google Colab as our development environment. This README provides an overview of the project and how it was executed.

Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates a student's percentage score based on their daily study hours. The project demonstrates a fundamental use case of data science and business analytics by leveraging a simple linear regression model.
